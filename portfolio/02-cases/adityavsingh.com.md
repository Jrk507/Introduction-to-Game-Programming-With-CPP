# Assessment 1
## Summary

- 1/25/2023
- [The portfolio evaluated](https://www.adityavsingh.com/)
- This profolio is about Aditya Vikram Singh a Software Engineer,Full-Stack Developer and his achievements and experience.

## Strength
Aditya Does a good job of outlining his experiences and involvements, He adds links to websites and small descriptions of each job or involvment and what exsactly he did on the project which is a really nice touch.[link](https://imgur.com/a/iMvvkZK)  He also does a good job of listing dates and years of when he attended each and also make in chronological order. 

## Improvements
- I think adding a small description of person would be a good touch to add as the first page is lacking in experience and personality. Also to have the visually theme follow suit with all pages it is a bit weird to have the background drastically change from page to page. Finally try to integrate your full stack knowledge into your Profolio.
- Who is Aditya Singh and what is your ambitions and goals? 

## Best fit
- Its short, sweet and gives a good outline of Aditya experiences and what would make him creditable. He also links to his git hub to view some of his projects 
- To create programs used in company as it seems he has a good amount of experience in software development and or program optimization.
- Software Developer or Software Engineer.
- He outlined in some experiences that he worked in groups of 4+ people and also has a long list of involment projects he was apart of which is a good look for how he would work with others and people.

## General considerations
- Overall it is well put together and made, its minimalist but not in a bad way. It gives you the information you need and links you need to go to. It just can be more personal and better visually to look at. 
- If possible, send a message to one of its communication channels informing your assessment;
